# SPEC-07 design: suppressing tests and retiring features through the spec

Status: **drafted in the protected files, awaiting Dustin's review and
`guard:freeze` (2026-10-07).** Until the freeze, `guard:check` fails on the modified
files, which is expected. See "Implementation (as drafted)" at the end for what was
built, how it differs from this design, and the calibration results. Decisions this builds on are in
[BACKLOG.md § SPEC-07](../BACKLOG.md#spec-07--suppressing-tests-and-retiring-features-through-the-spec).

## Summary

| Need | Mechanism | Enforced by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Knowingly accept a failing BDD scenario | `@accepted-risk` plus `@risk:`, `@owner:` and `@review:` tags on the scenario | Guard validates the tags and expiry. A new `accepted-risks` suite runs the scenarios and expects them to fail. |
| Say a shipped feature is gone | A "must not exist" scenario tagged `@retired @decision:D-xx` in the owning service's feature folder | Runs in the normal features suite. A rebuild that brings the feature back fails. |
| Stop informal suppression | Wider skip detection in the guard | `guard:check` (first step of `npm test`, a required CI check) |

`node:test` suites (contract, OBS, auth, schema, runtime, harness, performance) have no
suppression mechanism. `tools/review/` stays advisory.

## 1. Tag grammar

Gherkin tags can't contain spaces, and this repo already uses `@name:value` tags
(`@service:reservation`), so metadata goes in separate tags:

```gherkin
@accepted-risk @risk:REV-001 @owner:dustin @review:2027-01-31
Scenario: A same-key retry after a downstream timeout does not charge again

@retired @decision:D-24
Scenario: The legacy visit-cancellation endpoint no longer exists
```

Rules the guard enforces:

- `@accepted-risk` requires exactly one each of `@risk:`, `@owner:` and `@review:`.
- `@risk:` must resolve to a record: `D-nn` in `docs/specs/business-decisions.md`,
  or `REV-nnn` in a file under `docs/engineering-reviews/`.
- `@review:` is an ISO date. The guard fails when today is after it, and warns
  14 days before.
- `@retired` requires exactly one `@decision:D-nn` that exists in
  `docs/specs/business-decisions.md`.
- `@accepted-risk` and `@retired` can't appear on the same scenario, or at the
  `Feature:` level (scenario level only, so a whole file can't be waved through).

## 2. Guard changes (`spec/guard/guard.js`, `spec/guard/check.js`)

**Close the conditional-skip hole.** Today `SKIP_CODE` matches only `.skip(` and a
literal `{ skip: true }`. The REV-003 skip (`skip: cond && "reason"`) would pass even
under `spec/`. Proposed: in protected `.js` files under `spec/tests/` and
`spec/harness/`, ignoring comment lines, flag:

- `.skip(`, `.only(`, `.todo(` on any receiver, including `t.skip(` and `t.todo(`
- an object property `skip:`, `only:` or `todo:` with any value, using
  `(?<![\w-])(skip|only|todo)\s*:` so prose like "Administrator-only:" doesn't match
- Cucumber escape hatches: `return "skipped"`, `return "pending"`, and
  `this.skip` / `testInfo.skip` / `test.fixme` in Playwright

A scan of `spec/tests`, `spec/features` and `spec/harness` with these patterns
finds no real hits today. The only false positive, a comment in
`journeys.spec.js:276`, is excluded by the comment-line rule.

**Bare tags.** Keep rejecting `@skip @wip @ignore @only` and add `@todo @pending
@manual @disabled`. The only sanctioned ways to keep a scenario out of the main run
are the two tags in §1.

**Report.** `guard:check` lists every accepted risk with its owner and review date
on each run, even when everything passes, so the risk register is visible in every
log and CI run.

## 3. Runner changes

- `spec/cucumber.cjs`: add `tags: "not @accepted-risk"` to the `default` and
  `workflows` profiles. Retired scenarios stay in the normal run and must pass.
- New `spec/guard/accepted-risks.js`: runs Cucumber with
  `--tags @accepted-risk` across both profiles, reads per-scenario results from the
  message/JSON formatter, and inverts them:
  - fails as expected → reported as `ACCEPTED REV-001 (owner dustin, review 2027-01-31)`
  - passes → **an explicit state change**, not silent and not a failure (decided
    2026-10-07). The accepted state is "failing," so any pass is a change:
    `STATE CHANGE  REV-001  failing → passing on tree <hash>  (<file:line>)`.
    The suite still exits 0, because builds are disposable and a risk can come and
    go between rebuilds. The tag comes off only by human decision, through freeze.
  - If an earlier run record for this suite exists, the line also names it
    (`last failing: run <runId> on tree <hash>`). The reverse change, passing →
    failing, is reported the same way.
  - The change appears in three places: the suite's own output, a
    `stateChanges` array in the run record, and a banner at the end of the
    `run-all.js` summary, after the gate line, so it can't scroll away.
  - Build facts (language, database, libraries, cloud) never go in the spec. The
    review record (for example REV-001) says which build exposed the risk, and each
    run record says which tree it was checked on.
  - errors at step-definition level (undefined or ambiguous step) → fails. A broken
    scenario doesn't count as "failing as expected."
- `spec/test-policy.json`: add the `accepted-risks` suite to the full tier and select
  it whenever `spec/features/` or `services/` change. `run-all.js` needs no change if
  the script prints the same `N scenarios (…)` summary it already parses.

## 4. Worked example: retiring the legacy cancellation (D-24)

Tag `1.0` shipped `DELETE /api/pets/{petId}/visits/{visitId}` (`cancelVisit`). D-24
replaced the legacy app, and cancellation now lives at
`POST /reservations/{id}/cancel`. An agent reading tag `1.0` or
`docs/history/` could rebuild the old route. The runtime contract has no rule that
unknown routes return 404, so nothing catches that today.

`spec/features/reservation/retired.feature`:

```gherkin
@service:reservation
Feature: Retired reservation behavior
  Behavior that shipped in an earlier version and was deliberately removed.
  Each scenario proves the removed behavior does not exist. Do not implement it.

  Background:
    Given the clinic clock reads "2026-10-05 09:00" Central Time
    And Jordan has an Accepted reservation for Milo with Dr Avery Taylor on "2026-10-12" at "09:00" with the booking fee paid

  @retired @decision:D-24
  Scenario: The legacy visit-cancellation endpoint no longer exists
    When Jordan calls the retired endpoint "DELETE /api/pets/{petId}/visits/{visitId}" for that reservation
    Then the response is 404
    And the reservation is "Accepted"
```

New steps go in `spec/tests/steps/common.steps.js`: a generic "calls the retired
endpoint" step that fills path parameters from the world, plus "the response is
{int}". Assert on observable state, not on the absence of a trace, because every
handled request produces a span (runtime contract line 100).

## 5. Worked example: an accepted risk

The natural candidate is ENG-02 **REV-001**: a same-key retry after a downstream
timeout charges again. That needs a harness change first. The Customer stub would
need to drop or delay a response, which it can't do today (it only returns declared
statuses; see `checkout.steps.js:99-107`). That stub change is the harness gap
REV-001 exposed.

```gherkin
@accepted-risk @risk:REV-001 @owner:dustin @review:2027-01-31
Scenario: A same-key retry after a Customer timeout does not charge again
  Given Jordan's bill for Milo's visit is finalized with a balance of $50
  And Customer will time out on the next account change
  When Jordan pays $50 by card with idempotency key "K1"
  And Customer recovers
  And Jordan retries the payment with idempotency key "K1"
  Then the payment provider was asked to authorize exactly once
```

## 6. Agent instructions (`AGENTS.md`)

Add under Requirements:

- Scenarios tagged `@retired` describe removed behavior. They must pass. Never
  implement behavior found only in tag `1.0`, `docs/history/` or older tags.
- Scenarios tagged `@accepted-risk` are expected to fail on purpose. Don't fix them
  unless asked, and never add, remove or edit these tags. That is a human
  freeze decision.
- If the accepted-risks suite reports a `STATE CHANGE`, say so at the top of your
  final report: the risk ID, the old and new state, and the tree. Don't bury it
  in the suite table.

## 7. Proving it works (calibration, same discipline as SEC-01/ENG-02)

Before freezing, on a scratch copy, plant each of these and confirm it is caught:

| Plant | Expected catch |
| --- | --- |
| `{ skip: someCondition }` in a protected test | guard |
| `@pending` on a scenario | guard |
| `@accepted-risk` without `@review:` | guard |
| `@review:` date in the past | guard |
| `@risk:REV-999` (no such record) | guard |
| Reservation re-adds `DELETE /api/pets/{petId}/visits/{visitId}` | features suite (retired scenario) |
| An accepted-risk scenario starts passing | accepted-risks suite reports `STATE CHANGE` (suite output, run record, summary banner) |

## Open questions for Dustin

1. ~~Are accepted risks tied to a particular build?~~ **Decided 2026-10-07: no.**
   Build-scoping tags like `@build:python` would be unverifiable free text, and
   risks also depend on databases, libraries and cloud, not just language. A
   risk applies to whatever is built. A pass is reported as an explicit
   `STATE CHANGE`, not a failure (see §3).
2. **Scope for November:** ship the guard and runner changes with only the D-24
   retirement example, and leave the REV-001 accepted risk (which needs the stub
   change) for later? Or do both now?
3. **Expiry warning:** is 14 days before the review date the right lead time?

## Implementation (as drafted, 2026-10-07)

### Files

| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `spec/guard/guard.js` | Wider skip scan, now including `spec/harness/`. New `scanTags()` validates tags, references and expiry. |
| `spec/guard/check.js` | Prints the accepted-risk register and review warnings on every run. Fails on invalid or expired tags. |
| `spec/guard/accepted-risks.js` and `accepted-risks.cucumber.cjs` | New suite. Runs only `@accepted-risk` scenarios and classifies each result. |
| `spec/cucumber.cjs` | `tags: "not @accepted-risk"` on both profiles |
| `spec/test-policy.json` | `accepted-risks` added to the full tier and to the `services/{service}/` rule |
| `spec/run-all.js` | Passes the tree hash to suites (`PETCLINIC_TREE`). Records `stateChanges` and prints a banner after the gate line. |
| `spec/harness/stub-server.js` | `fault(method, path, "reset" \| "hang", { times })`: transport failures the contract can't declare |
| `spec/tests/harness/stub-faults.test.js`, `guard.test.js` | Self-checks for the faults, the scan and the tag rules (harness suite 45 → 50) |
| `spec/tests/steps/checkout.steps.js`, `common.steps.js` | New steps for the dropped connection, unasserted pay, the retired endpoint, and the response status |
| `spec/features/checkout/payment-idempotency.feature` | REV-001 accepted-risk scenario |
| `spec/features/reservation/retired.feature` | D-24 retirement scenario |
| `AGENTS.md` | Rules for `@retired`, `@accepted-risk` and `STATE CHANGE` |

### Differences from the design above

- **`@source:` tag.** REV IDs repeat across reviews (each review starts at REV-001),
  so a REV risk also names its review file: `@source:eng-02-review-r4-python-2026-10-07`.
  D-nn risks don't need it.
- **Three result states, not two.** Besides ACCEPTED and STATE CHANGE, a scenario
  that fails before its `Then` steps (setup or hook failure), or has an
  undefined, ambiguous or pending step, is an **ERROR** and fails the suite. It
  never tested the risk, so its failure proves nothing.
- **Ongoing reporting.** The transition is printed once as `STATE CHANGE`. Every
  later run where the scenario still passes prints `NOT REPRODUCING … passing since
  <time> on tree <hash>; tag still in place`. Both go into the run record's
  `stateChanges` and the closing banner, so the message keeps appearing until a
  human removes the tag. Per-scenario history is kept in
  `test-results/accepted-risks/latest.json`, which is local and gitignored.
- **The full tier now has 11 suites.** Older records and prompts that say "ten
  suites" describe the earlier policy.

### Results on the JavaScript build (sandbox)

- Harness 50/50. Features 285/285 (284 plus the retired scenario; the accepted risk
  is excluded). Workflows 11/11.
- REV-001 **passes** on JavaScript, so the suite reports `STATE CHANGE failing →
  passing`. That's expected: the JavaScript catch-all prevents the double charge.
  It hasn't been run against r4's Python Checkout, where it should report ACCEPTED.
  The sandbox can't run that build.
- The JavaScript platform already refuses to register a route missing from the
  contract (`services/platform/runtime.js:273`). So the retirement scenario mainly
  protects rebuilds that don't use the shared platform, such as the Python
  Checkout or any new language.

### Calibration (scratch copy, all caught)

| Plant | Caught by |
| --- | --- |
| `{ skip: Boolean(process.env.CI) }` in `common.steps.js` | guard: skipped tests |
| `@pending` on a cancel-reservation scenario | guard: skipped tests |
| `@accepted-risk` without `@review:` | guard: invalid tags |
| `@review:2026-01-01` (expired) | guard: invalid tags |
| `@risk:REV-999` (not in the review file) | guard: invalid tags |
| Reservation answers `DELETE /api/pets/{petId}/visits/{visitId}` with 200 | features: only the retired scenario failed (284 passed, 1 failed) |
| Accepted risk failing in a `Then` / failing in setup / undefined step | ACCEPTED / ERROR / ERROR |

### To finish

1. Dustin reviews the diff and runs `npm --prefix spec run guard:freeze`.
2. Run `npm test` locally (the full tier, now 11 suites).
3. On a Python Checkout workspace with these specs, confirm REV-001 reports
   ACCEPTED.
