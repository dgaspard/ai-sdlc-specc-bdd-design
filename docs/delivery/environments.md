# Delivery environments: what runs where

<!-- Generated from spec/delivery/catalog.yaml by `npm --prefix spec/delivery run catalog:render`.
     Do not edit by hand: a delivery scenario fails when this file and the catalog differ. -->

Every tool, service and check used to build, run and govern the system, sorted by environment.
**Required** means new work gets it by default and the pipeline enforces it. **Informational**
means it runs and reports but does not block. Each enforced row names the executable scenarios
(`CTL-xxx` in `spec/delivery/features/`) or existing checks that prove it; a planned row has none yet.
**Specified, awaiting X** means the scenarios exist but the delivery code is built in backlog item X;
until then they run as information only.

Region: `us-east-1`. Monthly budget ceiling: $25.

## Local

The agent's fast loop and the developer's laptop. Same images as the cloud, started with Docker Compose, test endpoints on, OTLP test collector, payment fake. Static and template checks run here; nothing needs AWS credentials.

| Practice | Tools | Use | Why here | Enforced by | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hardened container images | Docker | required | The same image runs locally and in the cloud, so local results carry over. | CTL-001, CTL-002, CTL-003, CTL-004 | specified, awaiting ENV-01 |
| Local system in one command | Docker Compose | required | Gives agents and developers the whole system without cloud access. | CTL-005 | specified, awaiting ENV-01 |
| Code, secret and dependency scans | Semgrep, detect-secrets, npm audit | informational | Agents see findings while building; SECURITY_GATE unset, so they report only (A-13). | CTL-013 | specified, awaiting CI-02 |
| Pre-push full-suite verification | git hooks, spec/run-all.js | required | Catches failures before they reach CI. | — | planned |
| Human-owned root of trust | guard.yml, CODEOWNERS, spec/guard | required | The protect-paths hook stops agents editing the spec. | CTL-022 | enforced |
| OTLP test collector | spec/harness/collector | required | OBS rules are asserted against real traces. | `spec/tests/observability`, `spec/tests/harness/collector.test.js` | enforced |
| Structured JSON logs | services/platform | required | Same format everywhere. | — | planned |
| Local performance thresholds | spec/tests/performance | required | Agents need the signal while building. | `spec/tests/performance`, `spec/features/performance/local-demo.feature` | enforced |

### Defaults for new work in Local

- [ ] Hardened container images (specified, awaiting ENV-01)
- [ ] Local system in one command (specified, awaiting ENV-01)
- [ ] Pre-push full-suite verification (planned)
- [x] Human-owned root of trust
- [x] OTLP test collector
- [ ] Structured JSON logs (planned)
- [x] Local performance thresholds

### Deliberately not used in Local

- **Least-privilege, pinned workflows**: Workflows run only in CI.
- **Short-lived AWS credentials (OIDC)**: Local never touches AWS.
- **Software bill of materials**: Generated where images are published.
- **Protected main branch**: Enforced by GitHub, not locally.
- **Signed build provenance (SLSA)**: Local images are never promoted.
- **AI provenance attestation**: Local images are never promoted.
- **Human approval to release**: Nothing is released from local.
- **Organization guardrails (SCPs)**: No AWS locally.
- **Audit trail and configuration history**: No AWS locally.
- **Hardened ECS Fargate tasks**: Docker Compose runs the images locally.
- **Secrets from Secrets Manager**: Local uses the harness's demo-only value.
- **Least-privilege IAM**: No AWS locally; the template check still runs offline.
- **Network hardening**: Not applicable.
- **Encrypted, expiring container logs**: Compose shows logs on stdout.
- **Traces in the cloud**: The OTLP test collector covers local.
- **SLOs and alarms**: PERF-01 covers local responsiveness.
- **Deployed load smoke test**: PERF-01 covers local.
- **No NAT gateway**: Not applicable.
- **Budget alarm**: Not applicable.
- **Ephemeral environments with a TTL**: Compose down is enough.

## Non-prod

An ephemeral AWS member account environment created by CI on merge, tested with the live tier, then destroyed when its TTL expires. Test endpoints stay on: this is a test application with no real data.

| Practice | Tools | Use | Why here | Enforced by | Status |

### Deliberately not used in Non-prod

- **Local system in one command**: ECS runs the images in the cloud.
- **Pre-push full-suite verification**: CI reruns everything independently.
- **Human approval to release**: Non-prod deploys automatically on merge so it gives fast feedback.
- **Network hardening**: Deferred 2026-10-10: test application, no data to protect. See PROJECT-PLAN deferred items.
- **OTLP test collector**: Replaced by the AWS collector.
- **Local performance thresholds**: Replaced by the deployed load smoke test.

## Prod

A production-shaped AWS member account environment. It runs only images already proven in non-prod, after a human approves, for a short promotion window before teardown. Test endpoints are off.

### Deliberately not used in Prod

- **Local system in one command**: ECS runs the images in the cloud.
- **Pre-push full-suite verification**: CI reruns everything independently.
- **Network hardening**: Deferred 2026-10-10: test application, no data to protect; would also need a NAT gateway or VPC endpoints, which breaks the budget.
- **OTLP test collector**: Replaced by the AWS collector.
- **Local performance thresholds**: SLOs replace load tests in prod.
- **Deployed load smoke test**: No synthetic load in prod.
